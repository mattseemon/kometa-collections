  The Cloverfield Collection:
    summary: >-
        Cloverfield is an American science fiction anthology film series and media franchise 
        created and produced by J. J. Abrams consisting of three films, viral marketing 
        websites linking the films together, and a tie-in manga to the first film titled 
        Cloverfield/Kishin (2008), all set in a shared fictional universe referred to 
        as the Cloververse. The franchise as a whole deals with creatures from other 
        dimensions attacking Earth throughout various decades, all as a repercussion of an 
        experiment by an astronaut team aboard the outer-space Cloverfield Station in the 
        near-future. Each film depicts the reality-altering effects of their study, 
        which was meant to find a new energy source replacing the planet's depleted resources, 
        only to open portals for assault from various beasts from deep space.
